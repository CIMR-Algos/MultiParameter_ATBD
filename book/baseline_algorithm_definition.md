# Baseline Algorithm Definition
## Introduction

In the following the main algorithm for the multi parameter retrieval is
described in detail. The algorithm is based on the works of
{cite}`Pedersen1991,Scarlat2017,Scarlat2018,Scarlat2020`. The algorithm is
divided into several steps, which are described in the following.

# Retrieval Method

## retrieval definition
The retrieval is following a typical scheme with the objective to minimize

$$
\begin{align}
œá^2(\mathbf y,\mathbf x,\mathbf S_e,\mathbf S_a,\mathbf x_a) = \left(\mathbf y-F(\mathbf x)\right)^\mathbf{T}\mathbf S_e^{-1}(\mathbf
y-F(\mathbf x))+(\mathbf x_a-\mathbf x)^{\mathbf T}\mathbf S_a^{-1}(\mathbf x_a
- \mathbf x) 
\end{align}
$$ (eq:chi2)


where 

```{math}
:label: eqxy
\begin{align}
\mathbf y= \begin{bmatrix}
T_{b,h,1.4}\\
T_{b,v,1.4}\\
T_{b,h,6.9}\\
T_{b,v,6.9}\\
T_{b,h,10.7}\\
T_{b,v,10.7}\\
T_{b,h,18.7}\\
T_{b,v,18.7}\\
T_{b,h,36.5}\\
T_{b,v,36.5}\\
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\mathbf x= \begin{bmatrix}
\text{WSP}\\
\text{TWV}\\
\text{CLW}\\
\text{SST}\\
\text{IST}\\
\text{SIC}\\
\text{MYIF}\\
\text{SIT}\\
%\text{SSS}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
```

i.e., $\mathbf{y}$ is the vector of input brightness temperatures (measurement vector) and
$\mathbf x$ is the vector with the corresponding physical quantities (state
vector), $\mathbf S_e$ is the error covariance matrix of the input brightness
temperatures, $\mathbf S_a$ is the covariance matrix of the a priori values,
$\textbf x_a$ is the a priori value, and $F$ is the forward operator, which is
the compositional forward model described in {ref}`fw-model`.  The optimal
solution $\hat {\mathbf y}$ which minimizes equation {eq}`eq:chi2` is found by
iteration. The uncertainty of $\mathbf y$ can then be obtained as 

```{math}
:label: eq:error
\mathbf {\hat S}_a= (\mathbf S_a^{-1}+\mathbf{ \hat M}^\mathbf T \mathbf S_e^{-1}\mathbf {\hat M})^{-1}, 
```

with $\mathbf {\hat M}$ is the Jacobian of the optimal solution of
{eq}`eq:chi2`. The uncertainty of the individual parameters is then given by the
diagonal elements of $\mathbf {\hat S}_a$. 



(fw-model)= 
## Forward Model
The Forward Model is the compositional forward model. It consists of individual
components, namely the ocean surface, the sea ice, and the atmosphere. At the
low frequency channels of the {term}`CIMR` satellite, the sensitivity to
atmospheric parameters is relatively small, but nevertheless the atmosphere
needs to be considered.
The forward model for Ocean and Atmosphere for frequencies 6.9, 10.7, 18.7, and 36.5 GHz is used from the AMSR2 ATBD from {cite}`Wentz2000`. 
The surface contribution to the brightness temperature is given by
```{math}
:label: eq:surface
T_{b,s} = C_{\text{ow}}*Œµ_{\text{ow}}*T_{\text{ow}}+C_{\text{fyi}}*Œµ_{\text{fyi}}*T_{\text{fyi}}+C_{\text{myi}}*Œµ_{\text{myi}}*T_{\text{myi}},
```

where $C_{\text{ow}}$, $C_{\text{fyi}}$, and $C_{\text{myi}}$ are the area
fraction of ocean water, first year ice, and multi year ice, respectively.
$Œµ_{\text{ow}}$, $Œµ_{\text{fyi}}$, and $Œµ_{\text{myi}}$ are the emissivity of
ocean water, first year ice, and multi year ice, respectively. $T_{\text{ow}}$,
$T_{\text{fyi}}$, and $T_{\text{myi}}$ are the brightness temperature of ocean
water, first year ice, and multi year ice, respectively. $C_{\text{ow}}$,
$C_{\text{fyi}}$, and $C_{\text{myi}}$ are adding up to one. With the fruequency dependent emissivities
for first year ice and multi year ice derived by {cite}`Mathew2009`. 
```{math}
:label: eq:Nizy
U_{T, t, p}=(a_{t}*T_{C}+b_{t}+273.15)*Œµ_{t, p}
```
with $U_{t,h}$ being the temperature corrected upwelling brightness temperature for the polarization $p$
at the air temperature at the surface $T_{C}$ (in ¬∞C), $a_{t}$ and $b_{t}$ are the frequency
dependent coefficients from {cite}`Mathew2009` (see {numref}`tab:emtemp`), and
$Œµ_{t,p}$ is the frequency dependent emissivity for the polarization $p$ from {numref}`tab:c_ice`

The ice thickness dependence at all frequencies is introduced via modification of the emission from the ice surface.
The ice emissivity is modified by the ice thickness $\text{SIT}$ according to
```{math}
:label: eq:ice_thickness
T_{b,p} = a_{p}-(a_{p}-b_{p})*\exp\left(-\frac{\text{SIT}}{c_{p}}\right)
```
with the index $p$ indicate polarization ($h$ or $v$) the coefficients $a_{p}$,
$b_{p}$, and $c_{p}$ from {cite}`Scarlat2020` (see {numref}`tab:fy_thick`). To
combine ice temperatuer and ice thickness dependence, the ice emissivity is
modified by the ice thickness  by substituting $a_{p}$ with the ice temperature
dependent $U_{T, t, p}$ from {eq}`eq:Nizy` for $t=\text{FYI}$. This was not performed in
{cite}`Scarlat2020` but is essential for the minimization of the cost function
to not introduce discontinuities in the forward model. The MYI emissivity is not
affected by the ice thickness in this forward model, as it was not part of the
thickness sensitivity study in {cite}`Scarlat2020`. 

To get back to emissivity in order to account for the atmospheric contribution
to the brightness temperatures at surface level, the brightness temperature is just devided by the ice surface temperature
```{math}
:label: eq:ist
Œµ_p = \frac{T_{b,p}}{\text{IST}}
```

With
$C_{\text{myi}}+C_{\text{fyi}}=\text{SIC}$ and $\text{SIC}*C_\text{myi} =
\text{MYIF}$ being part of the state vector {eq}`eqxy`, the state defines
the surface area fraction of all three considered surface types.

The reflectivity of
the surface, $R_{\text{surf}}$, is given by 
```{math}
:label: eq:surfref
R_{\text{surf}} = 1 -
Œµ_{\text{ow}}*C_{\text{ow}} - Œµ_{\text{fyi}}*C_{\text{fyi}} -
Œµ_{\text{myi}}*C_{\text{myi}}.
```

The atmospheric contribution to the brightness temperature is calculated from
the parametrization from {cite}`Wentz2000`. They fitted the donwelling and
upwelling effective temperature using a least squares fit to the {term}`TWV`.
The fit is given by 
```{math}
:label: eq:atm
\begin{align}
T_D=b_0+b_1V+b_2V^2+b_3V^3+b_4V^4+b_5\zeta(T_s-T_v)\\
D_U=T_D+b_6+b7V\\
\end{align}
```
where $T_v = 273.16+0.8337 V - 3.029\cdot 10^{-5}V^{3.33}$ for V<48 and
$T_v=301.16$ for V>48, $\zeta(x)=1.05x*(1-x^2)/1200$ for $|x|<20\ \text{K}$ and
$\zeta(x)=\text{sign}(x)*14\ \text{K}$ for $|x|>20\ \text{K}$. 

The absorption by oxygen is given by 
```{math}
:label: eq:abs_oxy
A_o = a_{O1}+a_{O2}(T_{D}-270)
```

The vapor absorption is given by
```{math}
:label: eq:abs_vap
A_V = a_{V1}V+a_{V2}V^2
```

The liquid water absorption is given by
```{math}
:label: eq:abs_liq
A_L = a_{L1}(x-a_{L2}(T_L - 283))L
```

with $L$ being the liquid water path.

The total atmospheric attenuation is given by a combination of the individual terms as from {eq}`eq:abs_oxy`, {eq}`eq:abs_vap`, and {eq}`eq:abs_liq`:

```{math}
:label: eq:abs_tot
\tau = \exp\left(-\frac{A_o+A_V+A_L}{\cos\theta}\right)
```
with $\theta$ being the incidence angle.


## L-band forward model
The addition for 1.4GHz was done by {cite}`Scarlat2020` and is based on {cite}`Ruf2003`. 

The atmospheric attennuation for L-band is
```{math}
:label: eq:tau_l
\tau = \exp\left(-\frac{0.009364 + 0.0000024127V }{\cos(\theta)}\right),
```
with $V$ being the {term}`TWV` in mm and $\theta$ being the incidence angle.

The up- and downwelling brightness temperature for L-band is given by
```{math}
:label: eq:tbud_l
\begin{align}
T_{b,\text{up}} = (1-\tau)(\text{ST}+258.15)\\
T_{b,\text{down}} = (1-\tau)(\text{ST}+263.15)
\end{align}
``` 
with ST being the surface temperature in K. Over open ocean, this is
{term}`SST` and over ice it is {term}`IST`. The composite upwelling and
downwelling brightness temperature is thenn
calculated with the weight of the ice concentration.


The effect of wind roughenning for L-band over open ocean is given by
```{math}
:label: eq:rough_L
\begin{align}
\epsilon_h = \epsilon_{h,0} + u(0.0007 + 0.000015\theta) \\
\epsilon_v = \epsilon_{v,0} + 0.0007u, 
\end{align}
```
with $u$ being the wind speed in m/s.

The brightness temperature which would be observed by an instrument in orbit is then given by
```{math}
T_{b,p} = T_{b,\text{up}} + \left((T_{c} ùúè + T_{b,\text{down}})(1 ‚àí \epsilon_p) + T_{b,s}\right) \tau,
```
with $p$ being the polarization and $T_c$ being the cosmic background temperature which, for L-band, is given as 6&nbsp;K  by {cite}`Ruf2003`. $T_{b,s}$ is the surface emitted brightness temperature (from {eq}`eq:surface`).
